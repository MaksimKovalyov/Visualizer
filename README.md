# Visualizer
## Description
This is a web-interface that complies with **[EPAM Mobile TAF](https://github.com/EPAM-Systems/EPAM-Mobile-TAF)** (informally known as **TestAidKit**).

The core design pattern utilized in this application is a Module Pattern. It allows creating private variables and methods connected with object instances.

All possible unhandled errors are directed to the application log.

P.S. This is my first real-life web-application, so don't judge me strictly.

## Architecture
*Coming soon...*

## Configuration
The attempt is taken to make the interface as user-friendly as possible. All of the UI controls are available by clicking the **\[?\]** button in the bottom right corner of the browser window.

* Remote server location = `http://localhost:37265`

* Log timestamp format = Short (HH:MM:SS.s)
* Log capacity = 3
